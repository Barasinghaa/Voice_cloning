# Voice_cloning
This is a voice cloning project ,in this I used a pretrained model from this repository:
https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS

**Features**

● The model is able to generate speech that is indistinguishable from the target speaker's natural
voice.

● The model is able to copy the accent of the original audio.

● The model is able to generate speech at a variety of speeds and pitches.

● The model is able to generate speech that is clear and understandable.

**Install TTS**

pip install TTS

If you plan to code or train models, clone 🐸TTS and install it locally.


git clone https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS

pip install -e .[all,dev,notebooks]  # Select the relevant extras
